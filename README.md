# Tribute Page - Stargate
Upon reading the pre-course documents we received I immediately knew what I wanted to make my Tribute Page about. Here was an excellent excuse to talk about something I've loved since I was 8-years old. At the same time I'd get to stretch my coding muscles for the first time.     

I knew what I wanted to write about... but how to do it...      
   
## Pre-pre-course
Before being accepted onto Cohort 8 with the School of Code I had decided that, no matter the outcome of my application, I would start learning to code and prepare myself (albeit more slowly).    

I began with a book my partner had bought for me which was quite clearly written for children, but provided a fun enough way of teaching myself.    

It was slow going.    

Then, thank goodness, I was accepted onto Cohort 8, did a little squeal of joy, and kept going through the book. I decided I could at least get practicing and familiarising myself with coding beforehand.    

I'm glad I did. When people say coding is learning a bunch of languages at once, they really mean it. Whilst I am not yet very fast (or fluent), I'm glad for the reading I did beforehand as this has allowed me to at least recognise certain elements used in HTML and CSS.    

That said, even the pre-course material has been a *massive* learning curve.   

## Creating the Page
My first priority was to make sure I would meet each of the user stories. I used the example provided in Code Pen as my starting point. Whilst I could have simply used that as a template and written what I wanted to say over the code on that page, I decided to write mine from scratch. Not the quickest way to create the page when literally provided with the template, but I wanted to ensure I was getting used to the way the code looks and works so that I could understand what I'm doing, rather than almost filling in the blanks. (Hopefully that makes sense, but I always learn better by doing something from scratch a few times).   

I had the example page and it's code on one screen and my own on another so that I could compare and see when I was going wrong and try to work out how to correct it myself.

I think this definitely helped to refresh my memory as a lot of the information from the beginning of the pre-course documents I had read a few days prior and so needed to revisit it.   
  
## Making Changes 
Initially, the page I'd created looked almost identical to the example, excepting the bullet point list, which didn't fit with the content or the style I was writing in. But I wanted to make it look a little different. Certain elements didn't quite look right in relation to the image I had chosen or the link I had included. So i made a few tweaks which I hope show I'm able to put my own (albeit rather simple at the moment) spin on something.    

### Changes I made include:  
* Turning the colour of the background behind the image to a navy blue to better match the image.  
* Changing the padding and margin of the background behind the image as I felt this looked neater in relation to the image I'd used.  
* Changing the font colour of the \#img-caption so that it was easier to read within the blue background.    
* Using a text specific to the theme of my page for the h1.  

## Reflections
Whilst I am pleased with the Tribute page as a first attempt at a project, there are a few things I would change or improve upon given more time or if I were to expand upon it further:  

### Background
I would use a background for the rest of the page which would further relate to the subject matter (stars in space / the "kawoosh" from an activating Stargate. This would need to be fairly transparent so as not to draw focus away from the text. I would also need to carefully consider the background if I were to use one as something like stars in space could make the text more difficult to read.  

### Font  
I would use a more suitable / relevant font for the main body of text. I really like the use of the Stargate specific text in the H1, and whilst this would not have worked for the entire text, I think it would look better using something similar but without the special characters.  

### Using a link in the image  
I think I can remember how to do this, but was slightly limited on time and wanted to prioritise meeting the user stories over adding extra features to the page. However, in future, I'd have a link from the image to either an external page/site about Stargate, or a second page going into detail about the image itself / the "science" behind the Stargate / the props department on set who created the 'gate for the show.  

### Additional links  
Similar to the above, I'd have links to either external pages or my own pages when referencing certain aspects of the show (e.g. when referencing the SGC / SG-1). This would add more explanation and depth to the project, instead of what is admitedly an extremely simple and condensed explanation of one aspect of the show.  

### More images  
I'd include more images to flesh the text out. Again, I could have done that this time, but wanted to focus on meeting the user stories.

## Summary  
This Tribute Page has absolutely helped me to refresh knowledge I gained in the pre-course materials, and the very brief studying I had done prior to being accepted onto the course.  

I'm really excited to learn more and for the course to start!
