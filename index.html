      <h2 id="headline">A brief summary of the history of the Stargate:</h2>
      <p>Millenia ago, long before humanity as we know it came to exist on Earth, a race of aliens known to us as the Ancients created a series of Astria Porta, or Stargates, to travel between planets. Whilst those across our galaxy believed these Ancients to be far superior to ourselves, many even having achieved immortality in the form of ascension to a higher plane of existence, the truth is that they were simply a race much like our own; explorers, scientists and creative thinkers.</p>
      <p>Long after the Ancients disappeared the Stargates were comandeered by a race of evil aliens known as the Goa'uld. They went from being used for exploration and the advancement of society, to a method of enslaving the human race.</p>
      <p>Then, one of the Stargates, which had been buried on Earth for centuries, was uncovered by Dr Paul Langford during a dig in Giza. In the decades that followed his daughter Catherine, archaeologist Dr Daniel Jackson, and a team of scientists discovered it's purpose. Dr Jackson, along with several members of the United States Airforce led by Colonel Jack O'Neill, travelled to the planet of Abydos.</p>
      <p>The people of Abydos were ruled over by one of the evil Goa'uld, Ra. With the help of the Abydonians, Jack O'Neill, Daniel Jackson and their team destroyed him and his space ship. But when O'Neill returned to Earth, Dr Jackson stayed behing.</p>
      <p>A year later, the Stargate had been locked up below Cheyenne Mountain, gathering dust. Daniel Jackson was declared dead in the explosion which had destroyed Ra, and Jack O'Neill had retired from the Airforce. But then the Stargate was activated again. This time by another Goa'uld, Apohpis.</p>
      <p>For ten years, the SGC, led by Colonel O'Neill and his flagship team, SG-1, fought the Goa'uld and the other evil alien races of the galaxy.</p>
